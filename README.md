# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

I was finally able to come out with a solution to this challenge. It is the first project I'm trying from this website.

This is my solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62).


## Overview

### The challenge

To make a responsive page based on the preview images in the [design folder](./design/) and the [style-guide.md](./design/style-guide.md) file.

The page is hosted [here](https://oieusouoede.github.io/stats-preview-card-component-main/).

### My process

I've got stuck with the image layers to get the color effect right so [this guy solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaHdmJf_ld4) was really helpful. Also I had a problem with the overlay div forcing its the container height to be bigger than the img element but I got it fixed somehow in some misterious way. Seriously, I can't point out what I did exactly but it fixed the issue (but I believe the div wasn't the problem at all).

Anyway, here it is.\
